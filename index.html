      I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current,
      if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s
      worth.

      “I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking
      to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience
      here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I
      enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best – and most
      grueling – time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully
      switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.”

      Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!
    </h4>
    <p class="texto">
      “Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed
      some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by
      step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only
      say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did
      not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for
      assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took
      my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In
      fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my
      development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack
      developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!”

      Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting

      “The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really
      refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go
      out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The
      standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need
      from an incredible community of smart and amazing people.”
